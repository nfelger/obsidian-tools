# Obsidian Tools

Tools, scripts, and plugins for my Obsidian vault and BuJo-inspired workflow.

## What This Is

This repository collects the technical components that power my Obsidian knowledge management system:
- Custom scripts for extraction and migration
- Code snippets and CSS customizations
- Helper utilities and automation
- Future plugins (as they're developed)

The workflow itself blends bullet journaling simplicity with digital searchability — a lightweight system designed to survive real-world chaos while supporting rapid context-switching and deep thinking.

## Repository Contents

Currently under development. Planned components:

- **Scripts** — Extraction, migration, and automation utilities
- **CSS Snippets** — Custom semantic bullets and visual markers

## Workflow Overview

The system is built on these principles: frictionless capture, continuous reflection, resilience under stress, and findability without maintenance. Everything starts in the daily note as a rapid log; reflection passes transform messy logs into durable knowledge through extraction and migration.

**For the full workflow documentation**, see [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md).

Key concepts:
- **Daily Note** — Single capture space; everything flows into one bulleted log
- **Extraction** — Moving content from daily logs into Projects/Areas when it has lasting value
- **Migration** — BuJo-style practice of moving tasks forward or explicitly dropping them
- **PARA-lite** — Simplified organization around Projects (time-bound) and Areas (ongoing)

## Tech Stack

- **Obsidian** — Core workspace
- **Periodic Notes** — Auto-generates daily/weekly/monthly/yearly notes
- **Minimal Theme** — Semantic bullets and visual markers
- **Calendar Plugin** — Provides navigation for period notes; highlights notes with unhandled tasks
- **Templater** — Note templates
- **Dataview** — Queries and summaries
